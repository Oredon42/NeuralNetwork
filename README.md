# NeuralNetwork

## Description
This project is the implementation of a basic C++ Neural Network library. The goal of this library is a way for me to understand how Neural Networks work, and explore the differents learning algorithms. The implementation uses the Multilayer Perceptron model.

## Features
 * Multilayer Perceptron
 * Gradient descent with backpropagation

## TODO:
 * File saving/loading for NN and Dataset
 * Other training algorithms *(Quasi-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt, ...)*
 * Prunning
 * Evolutions for image recognition
